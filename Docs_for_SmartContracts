Hello Everyone!!!!!

Created a github repo for the project. Then started working on project in vscode. 

Initial Setup and commands
-We have a main folder DigiAsset
-Open terminal
-Type 'npm init'
-type package name and other details

Install and Initialize Hardhat for building and test smart contract
-open terminal
-type "npm install --save-dev hardhat"
-type "npx hardhat init" -> We create many folders for us.
-install the recommended npm package by hardhat by copying and pasting command.

Now delete already present demo file under contracts folder we will create our own to write smart contract.

Install another package OpenZepplin which will help us in writing smart contract
-type npm install @openzeppelin/contracts

And now we write our smart contract.
